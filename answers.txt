Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a version control system that tracks what changes you make to files. It also allows many people to collaborate on one project and checkout multiple branches. This allows people to contribute to programs simultaneously. This is very handy if you are building a complex project. Additionally, if something breaks version control allows you to just go back and use the version that works until you figure out your new bug that needs to be fixed within the code.
