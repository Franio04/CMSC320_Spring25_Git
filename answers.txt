Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a version control system that tracks what changes you make to files. It also allows many people to collaborate on one project and checkout multiple branches. This allows people to contribute to programs simultaneously. This is very handy if you are building a complex project. Additionally, if something breaks version control allows you to just go back and use the version that works until you figure out your new bug that needs to be fixed within the code.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to many fields in the sciences and business. Businesses use data science to predict the products that their customers would want to buy. Through surveys they can query the market for its preferences and then tailor the companies operations to fit into the market niche that consumers want filled. In the sciences data science can be used to find patterns in the behaviors of the natural world. For example, if there is a large data set that requires analysis or an experiment that needs to be simulated prior to being conducted data science can help us investigate. Looking into new correlations can help researchers spot new phenomena uncovering how our natural world works.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: The difference between Merging and Rebasing is that in git merging you combine multiple branches into a single branch. However when you rebase, you move a branch onto another branch.
